EDCA-OS
Expression-Driven Cognitive Architecture
A next-generation AI operating framework for deterministic, auditable, expression-driven intelligence.
Overview

EDCA-OS (Expression-Driven Cognitive Architecture) is a next-generation AI operating framework that replaces prompt-driven randomness with structured expression control, deterministic behavior, and auditable reasoning paths.

It is designed to transform large language models from prediction engines into decision-grade cognitive systems.

EDCA-OS introduces a full-stack architecture that includes:

Semantic Control Layer (SCL)

Structured Reasoning Override Engine (SROE)

Structured Behavior Executor (SBE)

EDCA Protocol Stack (APS)

Expression-Driven Language Modules (Yuer DSL)

Runtime Auditing & Safety Envelope

Externalized Memory Capsule (EMC)

Graph-Route Scheduler (GRS)

This repository serves as the public architecture anchor, reference documentation, and ecosystem index for the EDCA system.

Why EDCA-OS?

Modern LLMs excel at pattern prediction—
but fail at:

behavioral stability

determinism

semantic safety

auditability

multi-step task consistency

EDCA-OS solves these through expression-driven execution, where control flows come from structured language, not uncontrolled prompts.

Architecture Summary

EDCA-OS
 ├── L0: Cold-Start Protocol (CSP)
 ├── L1: Alignment Core (ACP)
 ├── L2: Task Chain Protocol (TCEP)
 ├── L3: Micro-Task Protocols
 ├── L4: SROE – Structured Reasoning Override Engine
 ├── L5: Context Audit Layer (CAL)
 └── Runtime: SBE + SRP + EMC + GRS

This layered architecture provides:

deterministic behavior

symbolic-like control

safe chain-of-thought

recoverable context

multi-agent orchestration

structured task pipelines

Core Components
SROE — Structured Reasoning Override Engine

Override faulty reasoning chains and regenerate paths deterministically.

SBE — Structured Behavior Executor

Task-level execution engine with ACL, safety envelope, and audit-grade logs.

SRP — Structured Retrieval Protocol

A safe alternative to vector-only RAG.

Yuer DSL — Expression-Driven Language

The “programming language” that controls EDCA-OS.

APS — EDCA Protocol Stack

Defines alignment, chain-control, auditing, rollback, and safety.

EMC — Externalized Memory Capsule

Encrypted, pluggable memory module.
