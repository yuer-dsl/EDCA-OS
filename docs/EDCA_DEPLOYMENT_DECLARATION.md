🟦 EDCA OS Deployment Declaration v1.0 (Public-Safe Edition)

Author: Yuer (Guanyu)
Project: EDCA OS — Expression-Driven Cognitive Architecture
Document Type: Deployment & Responsibility Declaration
Last Updated: 2025-11-19

1. Purpose

This document defines the deployment principles, authorization rules, and responsibility boundaries of EDCA OS, an AI Behavior Operating System designed for deterministic reasoning, semantic-layer control, and auditable multi-step execution.

This declaration is safe for public use and may be included in GitHub repositories, documentation sites, and deployment packages.
It does not reveal any internal EDCA OS protocols, semantic-control mechanisms, or proprietary OS-layer structures.

2. System Boundary

EDCA OS operates at the AI behavior and execution layer, providing:

Deterministic behavior path control

Semantic consistency enforcement

Auditable execution chains

Multi-model orchestration

Task-chain stabilization

Responsibility attribution

The following components are not public, not open-source, and not part of this declaration:

Semantic Control Protocols

Internal Anchor Mechanisms

SROE / SBE full specifications

EDCA Runtime Kernel

Semantic Hardware Layer

Root Authority Authorization Logic

Any attempt to extract, infer, or reverse-engineer these elements is strictly prohibited.

3. Authorization Framework

EDCA OS follows a Responsibility-Based Authorization Model:

Authorization is granted only to “Accountable Entities,”
not to languages, tools, applications, or user groups.

To receive EDCA OS Execution Authorization (EDCA-EA), an entity must provide:

3.1 A Verifiable Legal Identity

Company / organization

Registered team

Studio

Verified individual developer

3.2 A Complete Audit Chain

Including but not limited to:

Input records

Output records

Behavior-path logs

State-machine events

Decision sequences

SROE rollback traces

Version and environment metadata

3.3 Clear Responsibility Attribution

Every action executed under EDCA OS must be traceable and legally accountable.

Authorization does not depend on:

Whether the application targets C-end or B-end users

Commercial or non-commercial usage

Application category (image, text, automation, etc.)

Application size or popularity

Only accountability and auditability determine authorization.

4. Language Openness

Yuer DSL is an expression-driven programming language and is intentionally:

Open-syntax

Publicly documentable

Free to learn and use

However:

Yuer DSL does not grant semantic-control rights.
Execution authority belongs exclusively to EDCA OS.

All semantic influence, behavior-path control, and deterministic execution are performed by:

EDCA OS Runtime

EDCA Execution Authorization Layer

Thus, anyone may write DSL code,
but only authorized entities may execute controlled behaviors.

5. Risk Containment Strategy

To ensure safety and industry compliance, EDCA OS enforces:

No direct access to semantic-control layers

All behavior paths validated by OS-level decision logic

Mandatory audit-signatures for critical task chains

Deterministic multi-model orchestration

Full replayability of execution sequences

These measures confine all potential risk inside the OS boundary
and protect platforms, enterprises, and end users.

6. Prohibited Actions

The following behaviors are strictly forbidden:

Attempting to reverse-engineer EDCA OS internal protocols

Attempting to bypass or forge audit chains

Unauthorized execution of EDCA kernel functions

Using Yuer DSL to simulate OS-level control behavior

Publishing misleading “pseudo-EDCA applications”

Deploying EDCA OS in environments without accountability

Violators will be permanently banned from the EDCA OS authorization registry.

7. Industry Positioning

EDCA OS is designed as:

An AI Behavior Operating System

A Responsibility Execution Layer above LLMs

A deterministic, auditable standard for enterprise AI

A semantic safety runtime

A multi-model orchestration OS

This declaration ensures deployment aligns with:

Safety

Accountability

Auditability

Engineering integrity

Industry compliance

8. Usage of This Declaration

This document may be:

Placed in the root of a GitHub repository

Stored under /docs/

Attached to SDKs, runtimes, and deployment packages

Provided to enterprises or platform partners

The declaration is public,
but EDCA OS core protocols remain proprietary and protected.
